# Backlog

Date: 2026-05-14

This file contains only the currently active detailed sprint work and the next detailed sprint. Keep broad roadmap items in `HIGH_LEVEL_BACKLOG.md`. Move completed sprint details to `BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md` at sprint close.

## Repository Scope

This folder is the public repository root for the engine.

Example games live inside this repo as nested projects under `examples/`. The main dogfood sample game will be `examples/beacon-world/` when implementation reaches that point.

## Backlog Hygiene

- `HIGH_LEVEL_BACKLOG.md` tracks roadmap epics, parking-lot ideas and coarse priorities.
- `BACKLOG.md` tracks only the active detailed sprint and the next detailed sprint.
- `BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md` stores completed sprint summaries and links to shipped artifacts.
- At sprint close, move completed sprint details out of `BACKLOG.md` and into `BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
- Do not let completed stories accumulate in the active backlog.
- Keep story text short enough for agents to load quickly.
- Each story should include tasks, acceptance criteria and verification.
- Documentation, code comments, identifiers, diagnostics and in-app text must be English.

## Current Sprint: Sprint 43 — Open-source readiness

Triggered by `Notes/codex_review_2.md` (open-source readiness audit, 2026-05-14). The review flagged release-hygiene blockers — missing LICENSE, stale README/DEVELOPMENT/backend docs, doctor vs bundle:check budget mismatch, one Cyrillic phrase in a research doc. Sprint 43 closes those gates so AGF can be presented as a pre-alpha engine without confusing first-time readers.

### Stories

1. **OSS-cyrillic-fix** ✅ — Replaced `"почти как в Unity"` → `"almost Unity-class"` in `docs/research/renderer-ecs-split-investigation.md`.
2. **OSS-hygiene-local** ✅ — `scripts/check-repo-hygiene.mjs` + `npm run repo:hygiene` script + prepended to `preflight`. Local mirror of `.github/workflows/repo-hygiene.yml`.
3. **OSS-license-metadata** ✅ — `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0), `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (Draco / Basis Universal / Three.js / Rapier / AJV provenance), `package.json` gets `license`, `repository`, `bugs`, `homepage`, `keywords`, `description`.
4. **OSS-community** ✅ — `CONTRIBUTING.md` (preflight contract + agent rules), `SECURITY.md` (DEV-only `__agf` boundary, vulnerability reporting).
5. **OSS-readme-refresh** ✅ — Replaced Sprint-1-era README with pre-alpha status, quickstart, what-works-today list, examples, agent workflow, limitations, roadmap, license.
6. **OSS-docs-sync** ✅ — `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` drops "wired during Sprint 1", lists actual command surface; `examples/backends/README.md` documents Node WebSocket `--serve` mode; `examples/backends/node-world-server/README.md` documents serve mode + threat model.
7. **OSS-doctor-budget-align** ✅ — `engine doctor` now splits main-chunk budgets from vendor-chunk budgets matching `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`. `DEFAULT_VENDOR_BUDGETS` default for `rapier-` / `three-`. Per-project `bundle.vendors` overrides. 4 unit tests (`tests/unit/doctor-vendor-budgets.test.ts`).
8. **OSS-backlog-cleanup** ✅ — `HIGH_LEVEL_BACKLOG.md` "Sequencing the M-list" updated to mark steps 1–6 done, list real outstanding work.

### Verification

- `npm run repo:hygiene` ✅ — 431 tracked files, no Cyrillic.
- `npm run typecheck` ✅.
- `npm run engine:check:examples` ✅ — 5 projects.
- `npm run imports:check` / `systems:check` ✅.
- `npm run test` ✅ — 65 files, 412 tests.
- `npm run engine:doctor -- examples/hello-3d` / `-- examples/beacon-world` — both clean, vendor chunks reported separately within their budgets.

### Deferred to Sprint 44

The renderer / asset-pipeline openers that were originally pencilled for Sprint 43 (PCSS-modern, PCSS-CSM, ASSET-texture-compress, cam-cinematic, env-cube, webgpu-spike, M17-lod-batched, ASSET-decoder-vendor verification) move to Sprint 44 alongside the remaining OSS-readiness work (CI parity, e2e stability).

Default sprint size is 8–12 stories per `feedback-sprint-size`. Sprint 43 lands 8 stories.

### Parking lot

Open work that did not make the Sprint 43 opener list. Each entry stays here until promoted.

#### Renderer (Phase 2 tail)

- `M21-shadow-pcss-modern` Rewrite PCSS substitution against the modern PCF chunk (Vogel + `sampler2DShadow`). S41 only touched the BASIC variant.
- `M21-shadow-pcss-csm` Extend PCSS substitution into `CSMShader.js`.
- `M21-webgpu-spike` Async WebGPU renderer adapter behind a profile flag (`project.json#renderer.backend: "auto" | "webgl" | "webgpu"`).
- `M21-env-cube` Cubemap environment source (6-face cross or per-face URLs) via CubeTextureLoader.
- `M21-cam-cinematic` Scripted camera-track playback (`{ position, target, duration, ease }` waypoints).
- `M21-shadow-soft` Re-evaluate `PCFSoftShadowMap` vs `PCFShadowMap` vs `VSMShadowMap` once three.js stabilises soft shadows.
- `M21-shadow-glb-acne` Self-shadow polish on low-poly GLB meshes; investigate per-material `shadowSide = THREE.BackSide`, scale-aware bias, or polygonOffset overrides.

#### Asset pipeline (M25)

- `ASSET-optimize-command` `engine asset optimize <project> <asset>` CLI invoking gltf-transform with project presets.
- `ASSET-lod-metadata` LOD schema + `engine check` validation (distances strictly increasing, fallback declared).
- `ASSET-texture-doctor` Doctor warnings: huge uncompressed PNG/JPEG, NPOT mismatches, missing KTX2 transcoder path.

#### Batching / scene composition

- `M17-lod-batched` Wire LodSelectionSystem to BatchedMesh's per-instance geometry id so LOD swap doesn't drop the entity out of the bucket.
- `M17-static-merge-spike` Static geometry merge with reverse `EntityId` lookup for picking. Strictly opt-in per-entity (`StaticMerge` tag). Deferred until a 10k+ static-prop project asks (see `docs/research/m17-static-merge-investigation.md`).
- `M3-c-load` + `M3-c-beacon` Wire `expandScenePrefabs` into scene-load + Beacon adopts prefab instances.
- `M16-cache-e` Reusable matrices / pooled scratch buffers inside the cache layer.

#### Runtime + dev surface

- `RUNTIME-progressive-loading` Asset manifest `priority: "critical" | "deferred"` + placeholder primitive + scene phases.
- `RUNTIME-idle-rendering` Render-on-demand mode for static menus / inspector tools.
- `RUNTIME-gpu-timing` Feature-detected GPU timing queries in dev builds.

#### Pre-utsubo carry-overs

- `M20-a..l` Netcode rework (carried from Sprint 32).
- `M2b-seed`, `13.13` audio, `10.5+` C# WS transport.
